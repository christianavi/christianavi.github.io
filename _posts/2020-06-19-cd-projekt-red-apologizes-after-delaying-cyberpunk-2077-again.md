Cyberpunk 2077 — an upcoming and a much anticipated video game developed by CD Projekt Red has been delayed again. Instead of its planned release on September 17, it is now scheduled to be released on November 19, 2020, according to the announcement made on Twitter.

The developer said that the game is "finished" content and gameplay-wise, but due to the game being huge and very complex in nature, they still need to iron a lot of things out from the game mechanics itself down to bugs. CD Projekt Red apologized for making its fans wait longer.

> "Our intention is to make Cyberpunk 2077 something that will stay with you for years to come. In the end, we hope you understand why we did what we did." <cite>— CD Projekt Red</cite>

Cyberpunk 2077 has been in development since 2013 and this is the second time the open-world RPG has been delayed. A trailer at E3 2019 revealed that the game will be released on April 16, 2020 but was delayed to September 17, 2020, and then November 19, 2020.
