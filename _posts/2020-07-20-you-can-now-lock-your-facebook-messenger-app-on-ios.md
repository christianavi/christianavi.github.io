Facebook just added the option to lock the Messenger app on iOS. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/12/facebook-testing-face-id-and-touch-id-lock-for-messenger-app-on-ios/" target="blank">Facebook has been testing the App Lock for its Messenger app</a> with a  small number of Facebook Messenger users on iOS only, but it's finally available for everyone.

<blockquote>"App lock is a new way to protect your chats from unwanted access. Opt in to use your device's Face ID or Touch ID to unlock Messenger, so only you have access to your chats."</blockquote>

The App Lock feature adds an extra layer of security to your Messenger app as a wholeâ€”it does not work on individual conversations. The App Lock gives you the option to always require Face ID or Touch ID when opening the app or only after a period of time without using the app has passed.
