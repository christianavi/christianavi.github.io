Lando Norris, a 20-year-old British <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/landonorris" target="blank">Twitch streamer</a> with almost 500,000 followers and over 4000 subscribers driving for the McLaren F1 Team stepped on his very first Formula One podium today at the Austrian Grand Prix after finishing at 3rd place, just ahead of <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton.html" target="blank">six-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton</a>. Finishing at 2nd place is another Twitch streamer, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/charlesleclerc" target="blank">Charles Leclerc</a>.

After qualifying in 4th place for the opening race of the 2020 Formula One season, Lando Norris was elevated to 3rd after Lewis Hamilton received a grid penalty, the highest grid position for the streamer and for McLaren since the 2016 Austrian Grand Prix. On the final lap of the race, Norris averaged a blistering **230.378 Kph** to set the fastest lap at **1:07.475**. Norris crossed the line in 4th place but was again promoted to 3rd following the issuance of a 5-second penalty to Lewis Hamilton for contact with Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/albon" target="blank">Alex Albon</a>.

<blockquote>"It was a long race but I kept going, I was trying to give it my all, a pretty cool last few laps having to push as much as I can – you can tell I’m a little bit out of breath.” <cite>— Lando Norris</cite></blockquote>

Lando Norris often streams 8 hours a day on Twitch while playing F1 2019, iRacing, Call of Duty, etc. all while still managing to *"work closely"* with his team for the 2020 season.
